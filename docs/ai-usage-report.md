# AI Usage Report – Assignment 1

## Tools Used & Use Cases
### ChatGPT
- Generated an initial portfolio layout idea (sections + structure).
- Produced starter HTML/CSS/JS templates aligned with the assignment requirements.
- Suggested improvements for responsiveness (Grid/Flexbox choices and breakpoints).
- Helped create simple form validation logic and theme toggling approach.

## Benefits & Challenges
### Benefits
- Faster starting point: reduced time needed to set up structure and styling.
- Helped debug small issues (e.g., theme persistence, menu toggle behavior).
- Provided reminders for accessibility (labels, aria attributes, skip link).

### Challenges / Limitations
- AI suggestions sometimes included unnecessary complexity.
- Needed manual adjustments to match course expectations and keep the design simple.

## Learning Outcomes
- Better understanding of responsive layout decisions (Grid vs Flex).
- More confidence with DOM manipulation and event listeners.
- Improved workflow: plan → generate draft → review → refine → commit.

## Responsible Use & Modifications
- Reviewed all generated code and rewrote parts to ensure I understood how it works.
- Simplified AI output to keep it simple.
- Tested across screen sizes and fixed layout/spacing issues manually.
- Added comments and improved naming/structure for readability.
- Ensured academic integrity by documenting AI usage clearly and not submitting unreviewed output.
